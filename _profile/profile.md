Hey, I'm Connor. I'm currently a backend technical lead at Red Hat as a part of the Advanced Cluster Security team by way of acquisition (formerly StackRox). I enjoy building things from the ground up, iterating through customer feedback and growing alongside customers. I'm passionate about distributed systems and solving problems in a scalable manner.
